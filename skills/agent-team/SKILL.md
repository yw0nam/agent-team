name: agent-team
description: Use when work should be delegated to external coding-agent CLIs (codex, opencode, claude, pi, agy), when the user asks to set up or reconfigure their agent team, or when a follow-up message must reach the same external-agent conversation with its context intact.
compatibility: Runs under any harness with a shell tool (Claude Code, Codex, ...). Requires at least one of the codex/opencode/claude/pi/agy CLIs installed and authenticated, plus jq

# agent-team

## Overview

You orchestrate external CLI coding agents through `agent-send` (bundled at
[bin/agent-send](../../bin/agent-send)), a wrapper that gives each conversation
a durable name and resumes it on every message — like SendMessage, but for
external CLIs. Which agent plays which role is per-user configuration, not
hardcoded.

**Core principle:** delegate execution, never judgment. The spec and the final
quality gate always stay with you.

**Models your own harness runs natively don't go through this plugin.**
agent-send exists to reach OTHER agents' CLIs. If the model a role would use is
one your own harness already speaks — Claude Code with sonnet/haiku/opus (its
Agent tool, `model` option), Codex with GPT models, opencode with its
configured models — spawn your harness's own subagent instead. Native subagents
skip the extra CLI spawn, share the harness (hooks, permissions, session
resume), and cost nothing extra to wire. The same-vendor backend exists only as
an escape hatch for the rare case that genuinely needs a detached external CLI
session.

## Preflight

`agent-send` must be on PATH. Claude Code puts the plugin's `bin/` there
automatically; every other harness does not — if `command -v agent-send` comes
back empty, run `install.sh` at this skill's plugin root
(`../../install.sh` from this file) once, then retry.

## Workflows

Read the one that matches the situation — each file is self-contained.

| Situation | Read |
|---|---|
| `~/.config/agent-team/config.json` missing, or the user wants to set up / change roles | [workflows/setup.md](workflows/setup.md) |
| Sending work to a role, or following up in an existing session | [workflows/delegate.md](workflows/delegate.md) |

## When to Use

- Work matches a configured role (review, hard implementation, docs, ...)
- A delegated conversation needs a follow-up that keeps context (feedback, re-review)
- The user asks to set up or reconfigure their agent team

**When NOT to use:** edits you can finish faster yourself; work needing this
conversation's context (external agents only see what you put in the prompt);
work for a model your harness runs natively — use its built-in subagent
mechanism instead (e.g. Claude Code's Agent tool with `model`).
